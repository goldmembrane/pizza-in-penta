    analysis_first:
      "On July 12, 2025, pizza shop congestion near the Pentagon surged to a new peak. This spike cannot be explained by routine lunch hours or weekend demand alone. Similar anomalies in the past have often coincided with heightened military activity or diplomatic tension, suggesting this event reflects more than just consumer behavior.",
    analysis_second:
      "That same day, the Financial Times and Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Defense had asked allies like Japan and Australia to clarify their expected military roles in the event of a conflict with China over Taiwan. This marked a significant departure from America's previous 'strategic ambiguity' and a shift toward proactive military coordination.",
    analysis_third:
      "Such a request likely triggered intensified planning activities within the Pentagon—potentially including overnight simulations, strategic briefings, and increased staffing. In these cases, demand for fast, easily shareable food like pizza tends to rise sharply, offering an indirect signal of internal activity levels. A similar pattern was observed during the Iran-Israel standoff earlier this year.",
    analysis_fourth:
      "In summary, the July 12 spike in pizza congestion appears to be more than a coincidence. It reflects the convergence of global geopolitical tension and real-time operational readiness inside the U.S. defense structure. The so-called 'Pentagon Pizza Index' has become a meaningful indicator of behind-the-scenes strategic movement.",
