      "On July 18, 2025, pizza congestion levels near the Pentagon exceeded the average score significantly. This spike seems closely tied to multiple international developments occurring that day. First, Taiwan’s Vice President publicly affirmed that Taiwan did not wish to provoke confrontation with China and emphasized its peaceful intentions—even as Chinese military pressure persisted.",
    analysis_second:
      "Secondly, Taiwan was in the midst of its large-scale Han Kuang military and civil defense exercise, which included realistic missile-attack simulations and involved 22,000 reservists and civilians. This exercise likely triggered increased Pentagon attention to regional defense scenarios.",
    analysis_third:
      "Furthermore, reports emerged on that day that the U.S. was accelerating the transfer of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, indicating NATO-level air defense enhancements. The reallocation of these air defense assets also signals shifting U.S. military priorities.",
    analysis_fourth:
      "In summary, the rise in pizza shop congestion on July 18 appears to reflect the convergence of rising Taiwan-China tension, ongoing large-scale defense exercises, and heightened U.S. military support for Ukraine. The “Pentagon Pizza Index” continues to serve as an effective barometer for real-time defense posture shifts.",
